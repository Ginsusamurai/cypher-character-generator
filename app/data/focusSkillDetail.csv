Natural Charisma,na,na,Enabler,Skill,{skill:['All Social Interactions']},"You are trained in all social interactions, whether they involve charm, learning a person’s secrets, or intimidating others. Enabler."
Natural Crafter,Intellect,3+,Enabler,Ability,[],"All commonplace objects or structures you craft are effectively one level higher than an average example of that object or structure. For instance, if you craft a defensive wall that would normally be level 4, its effective level is 5. Enabler."
Golem Body,na,na,Enabler,Complex,"{armor:1, might_edge:1, might_pool:5, attacks:['fists - medium'], notes:['Can not be trained/specialized in Speed defense rolls']}","You gain +1 to Armor, +1 to your Might Edge, and 5 additional points to your Might Pool. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe (though you do need rest and sleep). You move more stiffly than a creature of flesh, which means you can never be trained or specialized in Speed defense rolls. Furthermore, you are practiced in using your stone fists as a medium weapon. Enabler."
Golem Healing,na,na,Enabler,Recovery,"{recovery:{first_recovery:""delete""}}","Your stone form from the Golem Body ability is more difficult to repair than flesh, which means you are unable to use the first, single-action recovery roll of the day that other PCs have access to. Thus, your first recovery roll on any given day requires ten minutes of rest, the second requires an hour of rest, and the third requires ten hours. Enabler "
Golem Grip,Might,3,Enabler,Ability,[],"Your attack with the stone fists from your Golem Body ability is eased. If you hit, you can grab the target, preventing it from moving on its next turn. While you hold the target, its attacks or attempts to break free are hindered. If the target attempts to break free instead of attacking, you must make a Might-based roll to maintain your grip. If the target fails to break free, you can continue to hold it each round as your subsequent actions, automatically inflicting 4 points of damage each round by squeezing. Enabler"
Trained Basher,na,na,Enabler,Skill,{skill:['Fists']},You are trained in using the stone fists from your Golem Body as a medium weapon. Enabler.
Golem Stomp,Might,4,Action,Ability,[],"You stomp on the ground with all of your strength, creating a shock wave that attacks all creatures in immediate range. Affected creatures take 3points of damage and are either pushed outof immediate range or fall down (your choice).Action"
Weaponization,na,na,Enabler,Ability,[],"One light or medium melee weapon of your choice is built into your body, and you are trained in using it. The weapon is concealed until you wish to use it. Enabler"
Deep Reserves,na,na,Action,Ability,[],"When others are exhausted, you can push through. Once each day, you can transfer up to 5 points among your Pools in any combination, at a rate of 1 point per round. For example, you could transfer 3 points of Might to Speed and 2 points of Intellect to Speed, which would take a total of five rounds. Action"
Specialized Basher,na,na,Enabler,Skill,{skill:['Fists']},You are specialized in using the stone fists from your Golem Body ability as a medium weapon. Enabler.
Still As A Statue,Might,5,Action,Ability,[],"Drawing upon the power of your Golem Body, you freeze in place, burying your essence deep in your stone core. During this time, you lose all mobility as well as the ability to take physical actions. You cannot sense whatï¿½s happening around you, and no time seems to pass for you. While Still As a Statue, you gain +10 to Armor against damage of all sorts. Under normal circumstances, you automatically rouse to normal wakefulness and mobility a day later. If an ally you trust shakes you hard enough (with a minimum cost of 2 Might points), you rouse earlier. Action to initiate."
Ultra Enhancement,na,na,Enabler,Complex,"{armor:1, might_pool:5, speed_pool:5, intellect_pool:5}",You gain +1 to Armor and +5 to each of your three stat Pools. Enabler
Mind Surge,na,na,Action,Recovery,"{recovery:{bonus_recovery:{text:'1d6+6 Intellect Pool',time:'Action'}}}","In addition to your normal recovery rolls each day, you can at any time between ten-hour rests recover 1d6 + 6 points to your Intellect Pool. Action."
Absorb Kinetic Energy,na,na,Enabler,Ability,[],"You absorb a portion of the energy of a physical attack or impact. You negate 1 point of damage you would have suffered and store that point as energy. Once you have absorbed 1 point of energy, you continue to negate 1 point of damage from any incoming blow or impact, but the residual energy bleeds off with a flare of harmless light (you cannot store more than 1 point at a time). Enabler."
Release Energy,na,na,Action,Ability,[],"You release 1 point of energy you’ve absorbed with your Absorb Kinetic Energy ability, magnifying and focusing it into a blast of energy that strikes a single foe within long range for 4 points of damage. (If you don’t have any kinetic energy absorbed, you can still use this ability, but it requires that you transform a fraction of yourself into the blast, which costs 1 point of Might.) Action."
Energize Object,na,na,Action,Ability,[],"By focusing your Absorb Kinetic Energy ability on an object (like a weapon), you infuse it with your power. The object holds the energy until it is touched by anyone but you, so putting it into your melee weapon or the ammo of a ranged weapon allows the weapon to trigger the energy in combat. The energy inflicts 3 points of damage on the creature touched in addition to any damage the weapon itself might do. You cannot have more than one energized object on your person at a time. Action to initiate."
Absorb Pure Energy,na,na,Enabler,Ability,[],"When you use Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can also absorb and store energy from attacks made with pure energy (focused light, radiation, transdimensional, psychic, etc.) or from conduits that direct energy, if you can make direct contact. This ability does not change how many points of energy you can store. If you also have Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can absorb 2 points of damage from other energy sources as well. Enabler."
Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy,na,na,Enabler,Ability,[],"When you use Absorb Kinetic Energy, instead of being able to absorb 1 point of damage from a physical attack or impact, you can absorb 2 points. You can also store up to 2 points of energy from any source. However, you can still release energy only 1 point at a time. Enabler"
Overcharge Energy,na,na,Enabler,Ability,[],"When you use Release Energy, it inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. Enabler."
Energize Creature,Might,6+,Action,Ability,[],"You extend your Absorb Kinetic Energy ability to one creature within immediate range so that they also can absorb energy from physical attacks and impacts for one hour. That creature, however, cannot release excess energy as a blast. For each level of Effort you apply, you can increase the number of targets you affect by one. If you have Absorb Pure Energy or Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, those abilities are also duplicated in your target when you use Energize Creature. Action to initiate"
Energize Crowd,Might,9,Action,Ability,[],"You extend your Absorb Kinetic Energy ability to up to thirty creatures within short range so that they also can absorb energy from physical attacks and impacts for one hour. If you have Absorb Pure Energy or Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, these creatures can use those abilities as well. The creatures, however, cannot release excess energy as a blast. Action to initiate"
Overcharge Device,na,na,Action,Ability,[],"You infuse 1 point of energy gained from using Absorb Energy or related ability into a device, such as an artifact, raising its effective level on its next use by three (to a maximum of 10). Action"
