# cypher-character-generator
Web tool to build characters for Cypher System games
This will be a githubpages site using this repo to host the backend and the rest will be deployed via heroku to act as a 'back end' with custom API to query and serve the data to the user.
This will facilitate building out Cypher System characters from the existing options presented in the revised rulebook.

## Front End
* js, jquery, html5, css3, handlebars
* [githubPages](https://ginsusamurai.github.io/cypher-character-generator/)

## Back End
* heroku CLI, heroku postgres, express, cors, dotenv
* [heroku server](https://csgcharacterbuilder.herokuapp.com/)
